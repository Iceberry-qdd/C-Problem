## Introductions

- [Project1](https://github.com/Iceberry-qdd/C-Problem/tree/master/Project1)

  A question about Class definition and encapsulation. You need to create a Rectangle class and give a test program.

- [Project2](https://github.com/Iceberry-qdd/C-Problem/tree/master/Project2)

  A question about Class definition and encapsulation. You need to create a Student class and give a test program.

- [Project3](https://github.com/Iceberry-qdd/C-Problem/tree/master/Project3)

  A question about static members and friends. Please design a student class and give test procedures.

- [Project4](https://github.com/Iceberry-qdd/C-Problem/tree/master/Project4)

  This is a question about construction and destruction. You need to create a Goods class and write a test program.

- [Project5](https://github.com/Iceberry-qdd/C-Problem/tree/master/Project5)

  The point of knowledge examined in this question is operator overloading. You need to write a String class and write a test program to achieve these functions.

- [Project6](https://github.com/Iceberry-qdd/C-Problem/tree/master/Project6)

  This question uses derivation and inheritance. Create Complex, Real, and Root classes, respectively, and write test programs to solve one-variable quadratic equations.

- [Project7](https://github.com/Iceberry-qdd/C-Problem/tree/master/Project7)

  Examine knowledge of virtual functions and polymorphisms. Define an abstract class Shape, in which a pure virtual function area () is used as an interface to calculate the area. The abstract class Shape is derived from four derived classes: circle, triangle, square, and rectangle. In each derived class, the area of each figure is realized. You also need to write a test program to verify the feasibility of the program.

- [Project8](https://github.com/Iceberry-qdd/C-Problem/tree/master/Project8)

  Still testing knowledge of virtual functions and polymorphisms. Create Currency class and derive RMB class, JPY class,HKY class to solve it.

- [Project9](https://github.com/Iceberry-qdd/C-Problem/tree/master/Project9)

  This question examines the knowledge of templates. Design a template class and implement it like this:

  ```c++
  template<typename T>
  class Data {
    //Your codes.
  };
  ```
